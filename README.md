### Technologies Used

### Description of Operations

The game is played on a 3x3 board. Players take turns placing their marks in an empty square. 
Players choose which square to place their mark in by inputting the letter and number of the square.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
If all the squares are filled without anyone winning, the game is a draw.
